plt.figure(figsize=(10 , 8))
sns.set_style(style="whitegrid")

sns.barplot(
    data=df_plot, 
    x="count", 
    y="job_location",
    palette="crest"
)
sns.despine()
plt.title("Where Are the Top Locations for Data Analyst Jobs in the US?")
plt.xlabel("Number of Jobs")

        counts, 
        labels=counts.index, 
        autopct='%1.1f%%', 
        startangle=90, 
        colors=sns.color_palette("crest", len(counts))
    )
    ax[i].set_title(title)
