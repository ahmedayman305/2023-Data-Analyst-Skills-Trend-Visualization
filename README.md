### Visualize Code:

```python
df_plot = df_DA_US.job_location.value_counts().head(10).to_frame()

plt.figure(figsize=(10 , 8))
sns.set_style(style="whitegrid")

sns.barplot(
    data=df_plot,
    x="count",
    y="job_location",
    palette="crest"
)
sns.despine()
plt.title("Where Are the Top Locations for Data Analyst Jobs in the US?")
plt.xlabel("Number of Jobs")
plt.ylabel("")
plt.show()

## 2. What Are the Key Benefits and Requirements for Data Analyst Jobs?

### Description:

These pie charts provide insights into some of the key benefits and requirements for data analyst jobs:

- The first chart shows the proportion of jobs that offer work-from-home opportunities versus those that donâ€™t.
- The second chart highlights the degree requirements for data analyst jobs, revealing how many positions explicitly mention the necessity of a degree.
- The third chart outlines the availability of health insurance for data analyst roles, indicating how many jobs offer this benefit.

The data was processed using the `value_counts` method to calculate the percentages, and `Matplotlib` was used to visualize the results with pie charts.
